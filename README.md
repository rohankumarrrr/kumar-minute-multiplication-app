# Mad Minute Multiplication Game

This is an expo app. The link to the snack is attached.

This is my "Mad Minute Multiplication" App, designed to be quiz game that is fun but also educational. The game features three modes: easy (0x0 to 12x12), medium (0x0 to 100x12), hard (0x0 to 100x100), and custom (the user chooses the upper and lower bounds of both numbers). For the custom game mode, the user will be alerted on Web or given a toast notification on iOS and Android if their lower bound for a certain number is bigger than the upper bound for that same number. This app is best enjoyed with the ringer on the mobile devices turned off, as it features lots of cool sound effects that act as auditory feedback for the user for a correct or incorrect answer. I am once again importing animated, which is used for the countdown at the beginning and the incorrect answer. NOTE: I acknowledge that the code for my 'readysetgo' countdown function is EXTREMELY repetitive. My app also has AsyncStorage, which is used to save the high score a user achieves for their game even after they exit the app. I was thinking of creating an array with a separate high score for each game mode as a possible addition. I also imported a custom font called Chalkboy, to give the app a moe User-Friendly look. Each gamemode has a one-minute countdown timer, and the user can earn streaks for getting multiple questions correct in succession. The higher the streak, the higher the multiplier, which increases the score earned (the user earns 10 *  the multiplier value for each correct question).
